        <h1>A review of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Rating: <span class="rating">3.5</span></p>

<p>This is my first ever review of anything. I don&#39;t know why I decided to start now, with this book, but I did. So there we go.</p>

<h1 id="cory-doctorow">Cory Doctorow</h1>

<p><a href="http://craphound.com/down/" title="Down and out in the Magic Kingdom new page">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</a> was <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow" title="Cory&#39;s twitter profile">Cory Doctorow</a>&#39;s first novel. Written in 2003, it was (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cory_Doctorow&oldid=560885618#Fiction" title="Wikipedia page: Cory&#39;s fiction">according to Wikipedia</a>) the first novel to be released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" title="Creative Commons website">creative commons</a> license. Which is very cool. </p>

<p>Aside from having written <a href="http://craphound.com/?cat=5" title="Cory&#39;s novels">12 novels</a> to date, Cory is a co-editor of <a href="http://boingboing.net/" title="Boing Boing">Boing Boing</a>, fellow of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/" title="Electronic Freedom Foundation website">Electronic Freedom Foundation</a> and founder of the <a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/" title="Open Rights Group website">Open Rights Group</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_history" title="Wikipedia: Future History">future history</a> book takes place in the 22nd century, mostly in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World" title="Wikipedia: Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>. Disney World is run by rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhocracy" title="Wikipedia: Adhocracy">adhocracies</a>, each dedicated to providing the best experience to the park&#39;s visitors and competing for the Whuffie the guests offer.</p>

<p><small>(From the book&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_out_in_the_magic_kingdom" title="Wikipedia: Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom">Wikipedia page</a>)</small></p>

<p>The book is set in a future where:</p>

<ul>
<li>your brain can be backed up and re-loaded into cloned bodies, effectively meaning you can live forever (losing small amounts of memory between your most recent backup and your death).</li>
<li>money has been replaced by &quot;Whuffie&quot;, a live score based on your reputation and esteem with others. Whuffie works like money, in that it&#39;s easier to get stuff if you have a lot of it, and people also judge you based on your Whuffie.</li>
<li>everyone has a built-in HUD that displays information in real-time, including information about those they meet.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="my-review">My review</h1>

<p>Right from the start it&#39;s clear Cory has put a lot of effort into the technical details of the world. There are believable, technical solutions to death and money, and you can see how this world could easily be a logical future of the world we currently live in. We develop the ability to back-up a brain and re-insert it into a body; we are constantly connected to a highly-optimised version of the internet, which is feeding us relevant information all the time.</p>

<p>I quite like the idea behind &quot;Whuffie&quot; (although the word itself sounds ridiculous):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. Whuffie recaptured the true essence of money: in the old days if you were broke but respected, you wouldn&#39;t starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented -- your personal capital with your friends and neighbors -- you more accurately gaged your success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism by which Whuffie is attributed or how it is spent is never explained - we are just asked to trust that it basically succeeds at equating to the sum of your reputation, and it is what makes you rich. This is Cory&#39;s way of creating a system for a pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" title="Wikipedia: Meritocracy">meritocracyy</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, however, Cory doesn&#39;t revel in this technically ornate world he&#39;s created. We have to learn about the details incidentally as we go through the story. And despite the myriad differences between this future world and our own, the novel is written with a modern, colloquial and informal voice (Cory&#39;s standard writing voice), making the world and the characters seem very down-to-earth and familiar. Apart from the technical differences, from the feel of the characters and the relationships, the story could be set in the present day. And that is important: it helps us to feel at home in this otherwise very strange world.</p>

<p>This means that the novel is doing two things side-by-side. It is on the face of it a fairly mundane storyline about an un-remarkable member of this future society in the fairly uninspiring (sorry Cory) setting of Disney World. But at the same time this apparent storyline is simply a device for exploring the strengths and weaknesses of this potentially utopian future.</p>

<p>And that is the really interesting part. It explores the inherent problems with immortality, and the approaches that people might have to it in the real-world. It explores how a purer meritocracy might differ from our current capitalist society (spoiler: not much) and the potential weaknesses of that system.</p>

<p>But unfortunately, ultimately a novel needs to follow a storyline. And this is where, in my opinion, it falls down. Jules is not very likeable. In fact, for most of the novel, he&#39;s a bit of a douche-bag. As the story is told from Jules&#39; perspective, it&#39;s rather important that we can engage with him to engage with the story, and I found it a little too hard to do that.</p>

<p>This all meant that at the end of the book I was left with a slightly unsatisfied feeling; almost a dystopian feeling. But I certainly encountered some interesting ideas along the way.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Down and Out is the second book by Cory Doctorow that I&#39;ve read. The first was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_(Cory_Doctorow_novel)" title="Wikipedia: Little Brother">Little Brother</a>. I would definitely recommend Little Brother over Down and Out - it is a longer and more mature work, and it succeeds in being a more engaging read. This is not entirely surprising as Cory was 5 years and 5 novels more experienced when he wrote Little Brother.</p>

<p>Down and Out is nonetheless a very interesting exploration of a possible future and future technology, and will definitely interest fans of the author. And it is a very respectable first novel.</p>
