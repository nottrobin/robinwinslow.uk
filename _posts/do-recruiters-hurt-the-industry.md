This is just a speculative post. I have no sources other than my own experience and speculations, so there may be absolutely no value in what I'm saying. You can decide for yourself.

Recruiters are everwhere
===

I've changed employer twice in the last 3 years, so I've spent a fair amount of time scouting for good jobs. I must have communicated with over 50 people about new opportunities. I think maybe 2 of those people were actually from the company that was offering the job. The rest were recruiters.

You don't even have to be actively looking for work to encounter recruiters a whole lot. If your contact details are online in any way, they will find you. I get about 20 emails a month from recruters suggesting new jobs to me.

The how and why
===

It makes sense. Good developers are in a huge amount of demand, and can be hard to find. And the people who need to hire them are busy. They don't have time to find them. So they pay to have them found for them.

Recruiters aren't cheap. My understanding is that they tend to charge commission of between 10% and 20% of the annual salary of the person they end up recruiting - which probably adds up to between &pound;3k and &pound;10k. That's quite some overhead. But the companies must think it's worth it.

Because it's so profitable, there are loads of these recruiters. They keep massive databases of contacts from trawling the internet and from past clients. And they will contact (/spam) the people on these databases regularly with job specs.

The good
===

On the surface of it, I don't really mind recruiters. I've set up some filter rules to make sure their emails stay out of my inbox (I may blog about that soon). I get the occasional call, but I don't mind that. They tend to be very friendly. And it all serves to reassure me that if ever I do want to find another job, there is a veritable army out there to help me do it.

This empowerment is a really great thing if you're a developer. It's easy to find more jobs if you're unhappy. It's easy to find many options to compete with each other, which makes it easier to bargain and find your true market value. This transience forces the companies to look after their employees better to try to keep them around.

However:
- It's all about money? That's the easiest thing to compete on... going for well paid shit jobs?
- People don't stay at jobs very long
