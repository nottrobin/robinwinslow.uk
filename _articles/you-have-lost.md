title: "\"You have lost\": Owen Jones' searing message to the BBC"

Yesterday, the courageous Gary Lineker was finally forced to [resign from the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBa9Ox7iJnw), after heroically staving off pro-Israel attacks for months.

And this morning, Owen Jones, who has [thoroughly chronicled the BBC's anti-Palestinian bias](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/bbc-civil-war-gaza-israel-biased-coverage) since October 7th. published [one of the most powerfully damning condemnations I have ever heard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45wt3d3FEiU&t=1133s):

## Owen's condemnation

> <big>❝</big> Here's a final message to those who have hounded Gary Lineker out of his job, (who are no doubt celebrating):
>  
> <big>You have lost.</big>
> 
> *You have lost* the battle for public opinion in the West, which long ago was defined by revulsion at Israel's murderous actions.
> 
> *You know* that even former cheerleaders of Israel are publicly turning against it as they realize the scale of the crime is impossible to defend.
> 
> *You know* that in time both the *media* and *government* will be forced to reflect the *actual monstrous truth* and to act on it.
> 
> *And you also know*, deep down, that this crime is too *depraved*, too *extreme*, too *deranged*, too *shameless*, too *unapologetic*, and **too documented** to get away with.
> 
> *You know* that there will be a reckoning — that those who supported this abomination will, *within their lifetimes*, face the consequences of their actions.
> 
> *And you know* that the judgment of history will be *devastating*.
> 
> All you have for comfort, in the here and now, is the scalps of the people you've deprived of careers, reputations and freedom, and the *mass slaughter of Palestinians* you don't even pretend to consider to be human beings.
> 
> *You are monsters*.
> 
> And in time *that will be the consensus*. Politically, and indeed, **legally**. <big>❞</big>
