Hi everyone üëã

If you live in "Bicester South" (Langford Village, Graven Hill or Ambrosden), you'll see my name on the ballot paper on May 1st, for [the Green Party](https://www.greenoxfordshire.com/).

I'm a "[paper candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_candidate)", which means we aren't campaigning - I don't have the time. No-one is expected to have heard of me, & we strongly expect I'll lose. I'm just there so that people who want to vote Green can signal their support.

However, on the tiny off-chance that I did somehow win, I am committed to carrying out the role - so I thought I might as well put out *one* post about how I might be as a councillor:

Firstly, I have no experience in government or public service, so I'd very much be learning on the job. I'd try to approach everything critically as I learn, questioning things that should be questioned.

My day job is as a manager of a software team, so I'll probably look for opportunities to digitise or modernise whatever processes I see around me, hopefully to make local government work a bit more efficiently.

I believe in free speech and democracy, in everyone having a voice. I would support hearing from the invaluable voices of the community, and seek to have though conversations in the open.

I'm anti-austerity: I believe that society can only flourish when all members of our community are well looked after by well-funded local services. I would push for & support increased spending on public services in general - even though I'd have very little direct power over it.

I believe in economic equality: I'd prioritise fair pay and oppose the outsized influence of extreme wealth in government.

And even though it may not be popular right now, I believe that all forms of diversity make our society stronger. I volunteer for the [Asylum Welcome](https://www.asylum-welcome.org/) charity in Oxford, and I would continue to stand up for the rights of migrants and minorities. A welcoming attitude to visitors, and a firm commitment to universal human rights, are proud pillars of my British identity.

There you have it - if you see my name on the ballot paper on 1st May, those things are what you'll be voting for if you put an X next to my name.

Have a wonderful evening ‚≠ê  
Robin
