title: I am a blogger
description: Building a daily writing habit
---
This is my first post since 5th February 2019.

That's 21 months.

My determination to write has only increased over time, as my output has massively reduced. It's a strange paradox. I've been frustrated by it for a long time.

A few months ago I realised that what I really needed was a daily writing habit. I need to get away from imagining writing massive ground-breaking perfect articles, and instead just write. Exercise that muscle.

But still, I've been procrastinating. First I redesigned my site (more on that soon). Then I started looking for blogging communities to support me. Then I watched some videos about how to write blog articles. I tried to set up AdSense (just to see how much I could make). And on and on.

Then tonight I watched [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3vRK2P9lSU) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9uDVVWN_ZE&t=2575s) about self discipline which were really helpful, and gave me one key takeaway:

The key to being disciplined as a blogger is for me to believe that I am a blogger.

And now, just like that, I am a blogger. And bloggers blog. Every day.

This will be my first post in a long time, and hopefully the first of many, many short and boring posts just like this one.

Wish me luck! And self-belief.
