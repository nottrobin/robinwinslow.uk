I have been developing high-performing and high-scale websites for over 6 years, with experience of the entire web 
technology stack. I follow trends in internet development closely and have extensive experience of modern 
server- and client-side technologies including object-oriented PHP MVC frameworks, test-driven development and 
semantic and maintainable JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.

I am currently looking for a senior position near Nottingham which would enable me to develop my leadership and management skills while continuing to find innovative solutions for complex prolems, and to learn new technologies. 

At Hillarys I got the opportunity to lead the team in coding and management strategies for new and existing projects. I developed my leadership skills and worked closely with other development and marketing teams to introduce new working practices. 

I am very interested in flexible working practices for lean software development, and creating modern teams where developers can work and develop efficiently.

Hillarys
===

I am the lead web developer at Hillarys. I have been helping to develop a new modern web development team. I have been particularly trying to introduce more flexible, agile-based project management practices to the traditional company.

I collaborate with and work alongside Inviqa on Hillarys' largest-scale website. I have learned a lot about collaborating remotely and managing expectations of different teams.

I taught myself C# and have learned a lot about Microsoft hosting and .NET. I am heavily involved with managing two new Umbraco-based projects. I lead the team in decisions about version-control, code-structure and environment setup.

IPC Media
===

At IPC I was a key member of a small team responsible for 4 major brands' large-scale websites. Our team was part of a department comprising over 40 developers. The expertise and experience of the developers at IPC created a wonderful learning environment for me. I learned a huge amount about full-stack development and management of large-scale websites. I also gave two presentations on new technologies to developers from the department.

I became very interested in agile project management strategies, web performance, continuous integration, design patterns and behaviour-driven development.

Energise Ltd. & Mokoro Ltd.
===

During my MSc I advised Energise on a large-scale web project, and built the bulk of the solution in CodeIgniter. I also advised Mokoro on resigning their intranet for use by their consultants all over the world, and helped build the solution in Drupal.

Tamar.com Ltd.
===

During my MSc and BSc and during my year in industry I worked for Tamar.com. I was a member of a small team working on large projects and ongoing maintenance on ecommerce websites for financial institutions and online retailers.
