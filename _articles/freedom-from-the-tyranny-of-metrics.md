A terrible tragedy hast befallen my most beloved domain:

My archrival Anthony Dillon hast improved [his domain](https://anthonydillon.com), and now it beats [our own](https://robinwinslow.uk)! This is, of course, unacceptable.

The culprit - Google!

My site's homepage only really had 1 single external dependency, `gtag.js` which of course set up my Google Analytics. Most sites have Google Analytics, but using it still makes me feel dirty. I really only do it so I can have this table:

This is by far the worst performing part of the site, and pulls down my "performance" stat as low as 75% at times. You'd think Google could do a better job.

Tyranical metrics

Aside from the obvious complaints about how analytics [invades user's privacy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit-idUSKBN23933H), and also likely [breaks European law](https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/france-finds-google-analytics-to-be-in-violation-of-gdpr-due-to-overseas-data-transfers/), I actually think these metrics carry a sigificant cost on me personally.

I wish I wrote blog posts at least every week, or ideally much more frequently. But if you look at my homepage you can see that I actually blog about once a year. This is at least partly because of the pressure I feel to perform. I fantisise about how each post will be ground-breaking and universally adored.

I'm also kind of addicted to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nottrobin). On Twitter, metrics are right there. Every tweet has likes and retweets, and these really feel like the point. If your tweet doesn't have any likes, it's failed. I think this mindset has infected my psyche. It's why I take the same attitude to blog posts, and hence why I can't publish any.

Google Analytics is my crutch. It is the way that I can, at least in theory, see all my adoring fans coming to my site to worship my godlike content. And hence it's why I can never publish any content at all.

Moving on

So now I get to kill two important birds with one stone - free myself from caring about who actually reads my work, and also claw back the tiniest bit of self respect by not letting the wily [Anthony Dillon](https://anthonydillon.com) defeat me [in performance metrics](https://www.dareboost.com/en/comparison?reportIds=a_2621142e310b60b7e1a27376a&reportIds=a_2621142e310b60b7e1a27376b).

Next step, quit Twitter. But steady-on, one step at a time.
