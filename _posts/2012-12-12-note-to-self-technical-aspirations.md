Things for me to learn and achieve.

## To learn:

 - VeeWee...?
 - Require.js (AMD)
 - Composer
 - Design in the browser
 - Ruby & Rails (why not)
 - Dell Cloud Launcher & Profile Tool (https://github.com/sputnik)
 - Behat and related technologies

## To achieve:

 - Create Jekyll blog
 - Get Pygments working in Windows (blog about it?)
 - Setup a repository for keeping my development environment configuration
 - SASS/Bourbon/Require/AMD-up my site
 - Bootstrap/AMD-up my site
 - Set up some measure of CI for my site, including behat tests?
