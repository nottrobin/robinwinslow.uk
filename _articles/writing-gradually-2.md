title: Writing blog posts gradually
description: I'm trying to flesh out a scheme for realistic daily writing, in the open

A while ago I made a commitment to writing articles every day. After a good start in the first 5 days or so, this has massively petered out.

Part of the problem is that it was taking me at least half an hour every day, and with a newborn and a toddler and no extra childcare and work, this just wasn't feasible. I need to sleep at some point.

What I really want is to be able to do _some_ writing every day even if it's only 5 minutes. Or 2 minutes. Although I still think it would be good if I made an effort to publish what I've done every single time I stop.

To this end, I'm going to start publishing "in progress" posts. Actually, I already have.

This hopefully helps with my goal of trying to reduce my own expectations of myself, so I don't have to only produce quality content. Because that way lies writers' block.

I will build up posts over time, publishing as I go, clearly signalling that those posts aren't finished (although I might also come back and improve finished posts). Then at some point they will hopefully build into quality posts, which I might then share more heavily on social media etc.

We'll see how it goes.
